# 🧠 N-Queens Solver – Hill Climbing with Visualization

This project implements the classic **N-Queens Problem** using the **Hill Climbing** algorithm with **random restarts**. It includes a real-time visualization of the search process using the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) graphics library.

## 📌 What is the N-Queens Problem?

Place `N` queens on an `N×N` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other — meaning, no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## 🚀 Features

- Heuristic-based Hill Climbing algorithm
- Optional second-best neighbor to escape local maxima
- Random restarts when stuck
- Real-time board visualization with Raylib
- Displays number of iterations, conflicts, and restarts
- Clearly indicates when a solution is found
